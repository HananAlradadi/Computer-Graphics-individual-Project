# Computer graphics individual project

## Required Task
> - write an application that uses the graphic library to draw a scene (or even just an object) of your design. You can choose any object and try to draw all of its details using the basic shapes we have learned.
> - include line(s) or circle(s) in your scene by calling the (DDA, Bresenham, or midpoint) methods we have implemented in previous labs.
> - Divide your window into two parts. The bottom part is dedicated to your name and the top part for your scene/object.
